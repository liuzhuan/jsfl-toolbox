jsfl-toolbox
============
These are simple utilities to do the dirty job, such as sort library items by their types, give each item a name automatically, etc. 

You can download the jsfl scripts, and copy them into the _Commands_ directory. If you don't know where the directory is, you can run this command in Flash IDE in jsfl mode:

fl.trace(fl.configURI);
